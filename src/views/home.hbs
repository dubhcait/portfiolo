     <p>Since moving to London, I've become a regular at meet ups including CCS london, JS frontend and Code untapped. Mentoring at Codebar and at the FAC meetups, gave me a chance to listen and help others reason through challenging problems. I also enjoy teaching the Github evening in the founders and coders short course.

Right now I am focusing on learning cyber security and secure coding practices in my own time and regularly attending London Ladies Hacking Society events and other events to facilitate this.
